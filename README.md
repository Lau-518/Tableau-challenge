**CitiBike Official City Map**

This map enables the user to view which Bike Station records the lowest trips or highest trips. The user can filter through the number of trips and time-period. It can be observed that riders are more likely to start and end their journey in central New York, one of the main reasons is because of heavy traffic in central New York where people are likely to ride bikes to not get stuck in traffic. The other reason is due to demographic, the map layer represents the age per zip code, and it can be observed that younger people such as young professionals would rather reside in the inner city due to work being in closer proximity.  The map layer can be seen below.
